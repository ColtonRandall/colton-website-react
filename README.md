# Colton's React Portfolio

Welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹

This is an updated version of the first site I created years ago when I just got started ([see here](https://github.com/ColtonRandall/coltonrandall.github.io)), which was written in standard HTMl, CSS and JavaScript.

I wanted to convert it to a more modern framework, consolidating knowledge in React / Typescript, while using it as a canvas for future learnings. The transfer was done manually, without using any AI tooling. I figured doing so would serve my learnings better.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
